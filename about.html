      <h2>About SF Crime Analytics</h2>
      <p>
        As a San Francisco native, I've witnessed the rapid changes in crime rates across our city.
        SF Crime Analytics was created to provide a clear, data-driven perspective on the trends and patterns of crime in San Francisco.
        Using interactive maps and charts, this platform offers insights from various angles to inform public awareness and policy decisions.

        Our goal is to empower residents with transparent and accessible information, paving the way for a safer community.
